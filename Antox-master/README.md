Antox is an Android 2.3+ client for Tox. It aims to bring the full multimedia support Tox offers to your device, although it's still currently in heavy development. Antox is currently available for alpha testing on Google Play and F-Droid.

### Current development

I am too busy with my final year of university to continue working on Antox. You can find a maintained fork with new features being added [here](https://github.com/subliun/Antox).

### Getting Antox

To get Antox on Google Play, join the [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/103125800027884896310), and follow the instructions given.

To get Antox on F-Droid, add https://antox.me/fdroid/repo to your repo list. Please note this repo and domain are not controlled by me.

### What Is Currently Working

- One to one messaging
- File transfers
- Avatars

### Translating Antox
You can localize the application via github pull request or by requesting a new language or join an existing translation team on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/antox/). Please note that translation updates from Transifex are usually delayed.
